#Bass 6502 Assembler test program

testing Bass 6502 Assembler.

https://github.com/sasq64/bass

Mostly testing how it works and figuring out a few bits that may be useful to others. 

# object.s

two relocatable tasklets are generated here, really simple. 

# test.s 

incbin's the two tasks and locates them into ram ( not the same memory address as assembly time ) 
then runs those tasks
